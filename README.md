</br>
Meeting notes: discussed improving workflow and branch management to reduce merge conflicts. Agreed to clean up and merge branches more frequently, keeping branches closely aligned with main for smoother integration. Moving forward, tech lead will implement a tree structure: each subteam will maintain a stable sub-branch, with tech lead handling merges into main to ensure stability. Any personal branches will be deleted after merging into their respective subteam branches
